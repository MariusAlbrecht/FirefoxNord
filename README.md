# Firefox Nord

A Nord theme of the amazig Firefox browser using the ability of Firefox to have custom css injected to alter the layout.

### Usage

To use this you will have to first have to set up a funtcioning ``chrome``-Folder. The FirefoxCss reddit community has a good (guide)[https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/wiki/index/tutorials/#wiki_setup] on how to do this. You basically have to

- toggle ``toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`` to true in the ``about:config`` page
- create a ``chrome`` folder in your profile directory
- the profile directory can be found by going to ``about:profiles`` and then opening the root directory of the profile used (probably the default one)
