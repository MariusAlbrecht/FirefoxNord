# Firefox Nord

A Nord theme of the amazig Firefox browser using the ability of Firefox to have custom css injected to alter the layout.

take a look at the pictures (gere)[images.md]

### Usage

To use this you will have to first set up a functioning ``chrome``-Folder. The FirefoxCss reddit community has a good [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/wiki/index/tutorials/#wiki_setup) on how to do this. You basically have to

- toggle ``toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`` to true in the ``about:config`` page
- create a ``chrome`` folder in your profile directory
- the profile directory can be found by going to ``about:profiles`` and then opening the root directory of the profile used (probably the default one)

then you simply have to clone this repository into said ``chrome``-Folder

and set up the tst (TreestyleTabs) config. For that follow the guide in the [FlyingFox wiki](https://github.com/akshat46/FlyingFox/wiki/%23-Installation#treestyletab-css) and use the ``tst/treestyletab.css`` file.


### "Features"

- Polar Night (aka nord dark) colors allround
- rounded edges everywhere
- really nice TreestyleTabs config (look below)
- very clean pop up and mouseclick menus (because I removed tons of items in popups I dont like)

Especially because I removed so much I encourage you to use the [Browser Toolbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Browser_Toolbox) and change the code to your liking
